Here I  have single page application . Now I want to add ng-animate in the app . Angular js provide Single Page Application  . 
I add one feature transitions and animations using ngAnimate module.
Here I am showing 
how to animate ng-view.
Weâ€™ll use:

ngRoute for our page routing
ngAnimate to create our page animations
CSS Animations will be applied to the pages
Each of our pages will have different animations when leaving or entering the view
